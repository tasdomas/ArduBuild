This repository is based on the Arduino source code found here:
http://arduino.cc

The purpose of this module is to expose Arduino functionality to environments not using the IDE tool, which is
not suited for complex projects. The output of a make in this module is a static library that can be linked into
the final elf/hex binary for the AVR HW. 

It is assumed that the avr gcc toolchain has been installed in the system. At the moment the target HW is hardcoded 
for the atmega1280, but it is possible to change this in the makefile.
